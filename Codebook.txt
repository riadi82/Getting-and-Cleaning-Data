GETTING AND CLEANING DATA PROJECT CODEBOOK

ANALYSIS STEPS

1. We Download the File from the source and unzip the dataset
2. We then Prepare the labels for the columns , by loading data from features.txt and clean 
   them ( remove invalid characters such as '()' and duplicate phrase 'BodyBody is replace by 'Body' )
3. We also prepare the activity labels   by loading data from activity_labels.txt 
4. The next step is extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
   from the train and test dataset  and add the activities and subject column to each data frame.
5. Merge the train and test dataset into one data frame
6. Use The melt and dcast function from the reshape2 library to group the data by subject and activity 
   and calculate the mean for each measurement columns
7. The last step is write the result dataset onto a text file , named tidy_data.txt
